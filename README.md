Initial codebase for wireless sensor network simulation (as graphs) in Python
* Adopts Network clustering and Energy optimization algorithms such as LEACH by Heizelman et al, 2001 and SEP algorithm 
* Work was quickly discontinued and is currently under implementation in MATLAB and eventually, Omnet++.
